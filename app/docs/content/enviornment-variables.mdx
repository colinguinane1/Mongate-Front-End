import MdxLayout from "@/components/mdx/mdx-layout.tsx"
 
Set up your enviornment variables.

## Back End

Create a **.env** file in the root of the mongate-back-end directory.

```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27000
JWT_SECRET= < JWT Secret Here
PORT=8080
RESEND_API_KEY= < Resend API Key Here
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### MONGO_URI

To use MongoDB Atlas, you can sign up for a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or you can download MongoDB locally with their [community server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### RESEND_API_KEY

Resend is the mailing service. You can sign up for a free account and get your API key at [Resend](https://www.resend.io/)

### PORT

The port is set to 8080 by default. You can change this if you'd like.

### JWT_SECRET

You can also generate a JWT Secret easily online with [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/)

### CORS_ORIGIN

This is the URL of your front-end. The back-end will only accept requests from this URL with CORS.

### NODE_ENV

Leave this blank in development but in deployment set this to production, this allows you to use the production build of the app.

You will also need to add these variables to wherever you decide to deploy your app.
I personally reccomend using [Railway](https://railway.app/)

## Front-End

Create a **.env** file in the root of the mongate-front-end directory.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACK_END_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### NEXT_PUBLIC_BACK_END_URL

For the front end, you will need to set the URL of the back end. This is the URL that the front end will use to make requests to the back end.
